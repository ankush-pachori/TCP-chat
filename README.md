This is a simple TCP-based chat application that allows multiple clients to communicate with each other via a server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It can be used to demonstrate basic networking concepts, as well as provide a foundation for more advanced real-time communication applications.
This project includes both a TCP Server and a TCP Client:
      Server: Listens for incoming client connections, relays messages between clients, and manages active client sessions.
      Client: Connects to the server, sends messages to other connected clients, and receives messages from the server.
The communication is text-based and uses standard input/output in the terminal.

Requirements

1.Python 3.x

2.Basic knowledge of Python and networking concepts (TCP sockets).

3.Terminal/Command Line interface.
